# Deep Cascade of Convolutional Neural Networks for MR Image Reconstruction

Tensorflow/Keras implementation of reconstruct MR images from its undersampled measurements using Deep Cascade of Convolutional Neural Networks. It is forked from <https://github.com/js3611/Deep-MRI-Reconstruction> and it simply demonstrates on toy dataset borrowed from <http://mridata.org>.
